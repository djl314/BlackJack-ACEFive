BlackJack-SIM | Card Counting
==============================================
The Simulator takes a given basic strategy(BS) as input (defined in a .csv-file) and simulates the win/loss against a random shoe with user entered number of decks. The sim counts cards using one of  3 card counting systems selected by user. Depending on the current count, or other settings, simulation will adjust the bet size.

### Written using python 3

    python3 BJ_SIM.py [optional Strategy File.csv]
    -- if no strategy file passed it will read BS_1 or BS_2.csv by default --

For explanation of counting card values see wizardofodds.com

User can Enable or Disable card counting under GAME_OPTIONS ('usecount')
