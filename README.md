BlackJack-ACEFive | Card Counting | Betting Strategies | Custom Scripting
==============================================
The Simulator takes a given basic strategy(BS) as input (defined in a .csv-file) and simulates the win/loss against a random shoe with user entered number of decks.   Custom Scripting, Card Counting, Progressive Betting, ACEFive, Real-Life "Walk Away" scenarios.
<br>Using the Custom Scripting Tracker you can measure any data metric - Example - What happens to the House Edge when player exceeds standard deviation of maximum expected loss over a fixed number of hands/shoes 
Capable of Tracking Card counts in ALL possible card counting strategies | Winn and Loss Streaks | House Edge vs Actual Edge | Load from file the same set of hands using different betting strategies and measure the differences
Simulates REAL LIFE playing environment - user can define a "WALK_AWAY" logic to end the simulation

### Example of User Set Variables / configuration

SIMULATIONS = 5 #Simulation ends when # Shoes is reached OR Player_Bank <=BANK_RUIN OR def GetBL_WA() WALKAWAY returns True
SHOES = 12 #No. of shoes(games) to simulate in each simulation
SHOE_SIZE = 5 # No. of Decks per shoe
SHOE_PENETRATION = 0.25 # Remaining % of cards before shuffle 

NO_HANDS = 2 # No of hands(players) played each round | Set to any # of hands 1 or higher
BET_MINIMUM = 100  # Minimum Bet / hand -- MIN Bet over all hands should be 1-2 % of bank to avoid Ruin --
BET_INCREMENT = 50 # Progressive Bets - Increment wager after each win | set to 0 to disable Progressive betting
USE212 = False # Modified Progressive 
BET_MAX =  BET_MINIMUM * 15 #1500 #Max amount to bet on any one hand (pre split/double)
RESET_BETS = True # Reset Bets to BET_MIN and Streaks after each shoe
EXPECTED_LOSS_RATE = 1 # In percent / divided by 100 at execution | Casino Expected Loss  Theo Loss / For Comps

BANK_START = 10000 # Player Bank
BANK_RUIN =  0 #0 # bank amount below for RUIN
WA_ON_STREAK = 6 # 0 to disable | Times player reaches WIN_STREAK to trigger automatic WALK_AWAY (WA) | uses CT_Streak[WIN_STREAK[1]] to count
WALK_AWAY =  4000 #BET_MINIMUM * NO_HANDS * 10 # PL before Ending Game = WA walkaway
WALK_AWAY_TRIGGER =  12000 #used in conjunction with TRAILING_STOP
TRAILING_STOP = 0 # % of PL to use as trailing stop once WALK_AWAY_TRIGGER is reached when PL is positve | set to 0 to disable
LOSS_STOP = 0 #trailing amount from PlrBnk MIN to earn in event of WA Cut Losses | set to 0 to disable
LOSS_TRIGGER = 2500 # Loss trigger point overrides LOSS_STOP to WA if PL is back to >= 0 after falling below LossTrigger | LOSS_STOP must be > 0 to enable this feature
WALK_AWAY_BREAK = False # True # SET TO TRUE TO BREAK SIMULATION ON WALK AWAY - if False, simulation runs ALL shoes regardless of player PL or WalkAway logic(but tracks PL independently)

WIN_STREAK = [5,5,5]  # [neg count,neutral count, pos count]- dflt WIN_STREAK[1]| when progessive betting the number of consecutive hands to win before resetting to BET_MINIMUM |use inconjunction with COUNT_TIER[0] 
MAX_WIN_STREAK = 7 # MAXIMUM # of wins streak before lowering bet / #setting bet to minimum / overrides other streak settings
WIN_STREAK_RESET = False # Reset progressive after streak is reached - eg. if true hand is no. 7 bet as if 2nd win, etc | when false after win streak consecutive wins are BET_MIN until a loss
